# Udacity MLND Capstone Project: Traffic Sign Recognition
### Capstone project of Udacity Machine Learning Nano Degree
### Introduction
The following files are relative to this project:
  - Dataset: a folder that contains all training files and testing files
  - Standards: a folder that contains all standards images for traffic sign class
  - capstone_tsr.ipynb: main jupyter notebook that contains the code for this project
  - trained_resnet50: trained resnet50 model with 62 traffic sign weights 
  - Capstone_report_MLND.pdf: report file for this project
  - Proposal.pdf: proposal file before developing this project
  - sample_images: a folder containing sample images for final prediction.

Unrelated folders and files to this project, but as a follow up: 
  - TSR_detection.ipynb: main notebook that contains code for object_detection implementation of traffic signs using object detection api of Tensorflow
  - obj_detection: folder that contains files related to object detection implementation, such as ckpt files, train.py, etc...

### Software and libraries
  - Google Colab(GPU)
  - Python 
  - Keras, Numpy, Sklearn, TensorFlow
### NOTE:
- Results may vary to some extend from that of the report due to fact the code is re-executed after the report is made.
- The whole execution is performed Google Colab (using GPU instance), hence users are recommended to do the same in order to avoid the inconvenience of extensive modification.
- If re-executed in another system, users are requested to clone the notebook in their system and configure the paths accordingly.
- Also, the resources like datasets and images are downloaded and used locally, so make sure those are available (in this case-Google Drive) before executing the notebook and definitely follow step-3.
